#Cube Game

#Description
In this game you are a cube with the objective of reaching the end of the level without hitting obstacles or falling off the edge.

I decided to make this game because I enjoy Video Games and wanted to make one of my own. Through research I found that the Unity Game Engine is a 
great tool for beginners who want to get hands on experiance with game development, so I looked up some tutorials (shoutout to Brackeys!) and made this.

I hope you like it!

#Requirements
Windows OS

#How to install and run Cube Game

go into the Cube Game repo and download the zip.
run the executable in CubeGame > CubeGame.exe

#Controls

Press the 'A' key to go left
Press the 'B' key to go right

To quit the game there is a button "Quit" in the start menu as well when you beat the game.
I have not implemented a pause screen yet, so if you would like to quit while playing then simply press (alt + f4).

P.S. I know the last level is frustrating but I promise it is beatable. Good luck!
